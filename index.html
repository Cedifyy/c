							As a person who watches anime, I think it's pretty obvious that one of my dream destinations is Japan. 
							Tokyo, the capital is a place of technology and anime. Aside from being an anime fan, 
							I'm also interested in famous places like the Shibuya Crossing and Akihabara.

							While Tokyo is the place of the technology and anime, Kyoto is where the beautiful Japanese shrines and gardens are.
							In short, it is the place of Japanese culture.
							It is where most of the famous Japanese shrines are; and it's Japan, who would say no to Japanese delicacies like sushi, ramen, and omurice.

							The famous Eiffel Tower, the lights at night, the buildings around, and the culinary delights. 
							Imagine relaxing with your significant other during sunset with the view of the Eiffel Tower, drinking hot espresso,
							and snacking on famous croissants and baguettes.
